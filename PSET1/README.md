##Problem 1: Counting Vowels

Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s.

Valid vowels are: `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`. For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, your program should print:
`Number of vowels: 5`

#2.py
##Problem 2: Counting 'bob's

Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the number of times the string `'bob'` occurs in `s`. For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, then your program should print:
`Number of times bob occurs is: 2`

#3.py
##Problem 3: Alphabetical Substrings

Assume `s` is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of `s` in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if `s = 'azcbobobegghakl'`, then your program should print:
`Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh`

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if `s = 'abcbcd'`, then your program should print:
`Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc`
